## Disclaimer

I use this project for my Jupyter notebook code, starting from either courses like [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/supplement/), or other sample projects done by myself.

In this repository I'm using Python, in order to also gain some practice, like in [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata)! I try to make them as good as possible but I take no responsibility for any problems
or errors you may incur if you try to use them :)

## Features

Just a bunch of notebooks and helper code :)

## Requirements

- Python 3.12

You can install _My Python Kata_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

Open this project in Visual Studio Code with remote container extenstion and have fun :)
